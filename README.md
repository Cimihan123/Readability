# Readability
this is a readability cheking program based on Coleman-Liau index which gives the grade that can read the given text using the formula
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8
where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
